						Hello, my name is William Tanardi, I am a Software Engineer passionate about enhancing and optimizing web experiences.

						<br />
						<br />

						My journey into Software development began ever since I was little, it was my dad who inspired and introduced me to tinker with computers.
						Seeing my dad work on his computer fascinated me and from then on forward, I started to teach myself to do things on my computer along with my brothers.
						Over the past 5 years, I&apos;ve honed my skills in UI/UX design, Front-end web development, and Machine learning, working with various clients to create optimized experiences.

						<br />
						<br />

						What sets me apart is my ability to adapt quickly and do efficient work.
						I believe in providing accessibility for all and doing so in the most efficient way possible.
						Allowing everyone to enjoy these tailored experiences while providing great value.

						<br />
						<br />

						Outside of Software development, you&apos;ll often find me exploring one of my many hobbies, such as playing music, speedcubing, watch collecting, playing games, etc.
						I&apos;m constantly exploring ways to improve myself and test my limits.

						<br />
						<br />

						If you&apos;re looking to enhance yourself or your business, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to one of my social media accounts.
