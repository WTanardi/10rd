						I&apos;ve known Christ all my life, I&apos;ve struggled with my faith, many times, but never once did He ever forsake me.
						My parents weren&apos;t as lucky as I am, they didn&apos;t grow up knowing Jesus.
						When I was little, they only told me that they met Jesus after marriage.
						It turns out both my mom and dad though not christian, have heard of christianity and Jesus from their friends in school, but never committed themselves to follow Jesus.
						After they married, they had a neighbor that welcomed them and invited them to fellowship.
						My dad went along, quite well, but my mom still practiced her religion.
						One day, after my big brother was born, at the time my mom was pregnant with me, my dad asked my mom to take him to church.
						My mom, not wanting to wait in the hot car, decided to come inside as well.
						That&apos;s when she heard the sermon and burst into tears, something just clicked, and there she experienced Jesus firsthand.
						From then on forward, she decided to be baptized and became a follower of Christ.

						<br />
						<br />

						So, ever since I was little, they&apos;ve introduced me to Christ.
						I went to sunday school, read the bible, prayed daily, and served in church.
						Back then, I didn&apos;t understand what it takes and what it means to serve, I only knew that I was helping others, and didn&apos;t think much of it.
						I just thought, &quot;Oh, yeah, sure, I&apos;ll play the guitar, maybe through this, I&apos;ll be good at it someday&quot;.
						In school, I was above average, I got pretty good grades and I behaved.
						But several times I got sent home, why? because it turns out that my parents were late on payments, as it was a private school.
						That was when I started to fade in my faith, and the pandemic made it even worse.
						My faith hit rock bottom in the pandemic, I thought &quot;Why bother thinking about christianity, nothing is going well&quot;.
						This went on until I got to university, where I went to another city.
						There, I felt empty, I spent my weekends doing absolutely nothing.
						Until one day, one of my uni senior invited me to fellowship.
						I thought &quot;Eh, why not? I&apos;ll be exploring the city anyway&quot;.
						When I got there, I was surprised, they greeted my with pure joy and love, even though they didn&apos;t know me.
						I felt welcome, I felt loved.
						From then on forward, I stuck with them, went to church with them, we grew together, and served together.

						<br />
						<br />

						I thank God for them and for all He&apos;s done to me, and that is the sole reason I serve today.
						I&apos;ve served for and with students in my faculty, I&apos;ve served for students in my uni, and I&apos;ve served in church.
						Through evangelism and discipleship I&apos;ve met and served with a lot of great people.
						I long to see where He&apos;ll send me next.

						<br />
						<br />

						Soli Deo Gloria !
